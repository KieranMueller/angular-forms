  <h3>What is SCSS?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>SCSS stands for 'Sassy Cascading Stylesheets'</li>
    <li>
      It's a mixture of Sass (syntactically awesome stylesheet) and CSS
      (cascading stylesheets)
    </li>
    <li>
      You may have noticed these styling options when generating a new Angular
      project with the Angular CLI
    </li>
    <li>
      As a CSS pre-processor, SCSS is an extension to CSS, containing the
      benefits of Sass, while allowing plain ol' CSS as well, making it an
      excellent stepping stone away from CSS
    </li>
    <li>SCSS supports nesting, variables, and much more</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How do I incorporate SCSS into my application?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you generate a new Angular project using the CLI and choose SCSS as
      your styling option, you can use it from the get go without any additional
      steps
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are working on an existing project that uses CSS, first download
      the extension 'Live Sass Compiler'
    </li>
    <img src="../../assets/images/scss-extension.png" alt="code" />
    <li>
      Rename the css file extension you'd like to work with to from .css to
      .scss
    </li>
    <li>
      You will see an error until you click 'Watch Sass', a button that was just
      added to the bottom of your VS Code by the 'Live Sass Compiler' extension
    </li>
    <img src="../../assets/images/scss-watch.png" alt="code" />
    <li>
      While watching, this extension will automatically create a backing css
      file in your component directory, where any SCSS you write, gets mapped
      to, as browsers do not support SCSS
    </li>
    <img src="../../assets/images/scss-folders.png" alt="code" />
    <li>
      At any time, you can jump over and look at the code that is being created
      for you in the css file, from the SCSS that you are writing
    </li>
    <li>
      Take a look at the grocery list above and checkout the SCSS file compared
      to the CSS file (that was automatically generate for us)
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Take note of the nesting, and two variables defined at the top of the
        SCSS file
      </li>
    </ul>
